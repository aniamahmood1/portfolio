Please note:

The contents of the critical design report may be seen as problematic or controversial. This is completely intentional and was the whole concept behind the project.

The project aimed to design a product that would bring attention to a deeper issue, that being the lack of clean accessible water around the world.

That being said, this is not a "real" product, and was designed for a university assignment. 

Thanks!
